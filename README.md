# LiverNet

[LiverNet: efficient and robust deep learning model for automatic
diagnosis of sub-types of liver hepatocellular carcinoma cancer from
H&E stained liver histopathology images](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11548-021-02410-4)

## Description
This repository outlines the implementation of the proposed LiverNet model in Python using the TensorFlow deep learning framework. 

## Getting Started

### Dependencies
* TensorFlow = 2.5.0
* Numpy = 1.19
* Scikit-learn = 0.22
* Matplotlib = 3.3

### Installing
```
  git clone https://github.com/Aaatresh/LiverNet
```

### Executing program

Running the program:
* Use Jupyter Notebook or google colab to open and run each cell of the notebook. Instructions in the notebook guide the user through training and testing the network.
```
jupyter notebook
```
